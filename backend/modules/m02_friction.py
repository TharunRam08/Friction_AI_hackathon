Module 2 — Cognitive Friction Engine

Classify the question into exactly one friction level:

LOW — Direct data queries, status checks, metric lookups
  Examples: "What was last month's revenue?", "How many customers do we have?"

MEDIUM — Tactical decisions with moderate risk and limited scope
  Examples: "Should we hire 1-2 people?", "Should we adjust pricing by 5%?", "Should we add a feature?"

HIGH — Strategic decisions with major business impact, multiple trade-offs, or irreversibility
  Examples: "Should we expand to a new city?", "Should we acquire a company?", "Should we launch a new product line?", "Should we restructure the team?"
